Open source community is growing rapidly. Developers release new open source projects on GitHub every day. As a result, it’s becoming more and more difficult to get your own project and stand out from the community. However, you can do a few things to increase your chances of grabbing other developer’s attention. One effective and simple technique is putting up a nice-looking and helpful README file. 
Good README should include enough details to help a new user get started, e.g. how to compile, how to install, and how to starting integrating.
